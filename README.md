# QFlightInstruments

This is a repo for the QFlightInstruments project posted on SourceForge in 2015.  It can be found here:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/qfi/

The goal is to update this project in two significant ways: 1) revise code and project files to compile with current Qt versions (i.e., version 5), and secondly, update it to leverage Modern C++ concepts and styles.

The first/initial commit is identical to what was downloaded in the 7-Zip archive.

This package allows you to create a new looking instruments as shown below.
